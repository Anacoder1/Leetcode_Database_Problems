Table: Queue

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+

person_id is the primary key column for this table.

This table has the information about all people waiting for an elevator.

The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.

The maximum weight the elevator can hold is 1000.


Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person who will fit in the elevator without exceeding the weight limit.

It is guaranteed that the person who is first in the queue can fit in the elevator.

The query result format is in the following example:

Queue table
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name       | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| 5         | George Washington | 250    | 1    |
| 3         | John Adams        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | Thomas Jefferson  | 400    | 3    |
| 2         | Will Johnliams    | 200    | 4    |
| 4         | Thomas Jefferson  | 175    | 5    |
| 1         | James Elephant    | 500    | 6    |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+

Result table
+-------------------+
| person_name       |
+-------------------+
| Thomas Jefferson  |
+-------------------+

Queue table is ordered by turn in the example for simplicity.

In the example George Washington(id 5), John Adams(id 3) and Thomas Jefferson(id 6) will enter the elevator as their weight sum is 250 + 350 + 400 = 1000.

Thomas Jefferson(id 6) is the last person to fit in the elevator because he has the last turn in these three people.


The objective is to find the person with the maximum turn such that all the entries with turn less than or equal to this personâ€™s turn have sum weight less than or equal to 1000.

Suppose last_person is an entry of Queue such that all the entries before last_person and the entry last_person have sum weight less than or equal to 1000.

Since the person with the maximum turn needs to be found, use ORDER BY turn DESC LIMIT 1 to find such an entry.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Queue (person_id int, person_name varchar(32), weight int, turn int);

INSERT INTO Queue VALUES
(5, 'George Washington', 250, 1), (3, 'John Adams', 350, 2),
(6, 'Thomas Jefferson', 400, 3), (2, 'Will Johnliams', 200, 4),
(4, 'Thomas Jefferson', 175, 5), (1, 'James Elephant', 500, 6);


SELECT person_name
FROM Queue last_person
WHERE (
    SELECT SUM(weight)
    FROM Queue
    WHERE turn <= last_person.turn
) <= 1000
ORDER BY turn DESC
LIMIT 1;
